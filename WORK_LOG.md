Also, Vikram proposed an idea that seemed interesting, but I'm not sure if I would actually want to use that. |

Then, I started to think about what sorts of patterns might be in the English language by looking at the slides from the day before with the poem. I thought about spaces, and also started thinking about exploiting super commonly said words in some way. |
| December 4 | 6:00pm-7:30pm | I started to really think about how it could work. I first had a thought that if you could figure out how many unique characters there are, maybe you wouldn't need as many bits to store each character, instead of using 8 bits per you could just use 5 or 6. However, I don't know how applicable this actually will be since you would have to scan through the entire length to figure out how many unique things there are and then, how much bits would I actually save if there are still many unique characters. So instead of looking at the words and each character, I started thinking about compressing phrases. Maybe instead, you could assign each phrase a value and then have some sort of header and like a map so that the expand can actually understand what each word means. I started and was only able to get to thinking about how to compress the function. Essentially what I am going to do is have either a trie or a TST probably a TST where you first fill it with standard ASCII so that would be 256 entries. Then you read the first file from the character. While there is still stuff in the file what you are going to want to do is to try to grab as many characters in a chunk to combine before moving on. So first you start with whatever you have I'm just going to call it the chunk. Then you want to also keep track of the next character. First you want to check if the dictionary that you have already contains the chunk + the next character put together. If it does then you want to look even further ahead. If it doesn't then that means that you need to save that pattern in some way. So you output the pattern for the code you do know which would be the current chunk. Then you add the new pattern which would be the chunk + the next character. And finally you would reset the chunk to include the chunk+prefix. Then, when the loop finishes there is an issue. Let's say that you have hh or something when you are done. That means you have a chunk that you never wrote in because when you check if there are more characters there aren't any. So, you would want to add that code and then have some sort of header or something to tell the code to stop, probably an ASCII value that is super rarely used. I haven't really worked that part out yet but I think the rest of it might work. |
